                    One way that I think would be to interesting to give back to the community is through mentoring or teaching.
                    In my past I have had many mentors and teachers who have helped me in various ways to progress in whatever
                    I was committed to whether it be sports or school. From that experience I think it's very important especially
                    for younger kids to get that same chance as it has the potential to be a great benefit to their lives. One area
                    I would like to mentor in would be through playing basketball, coaching in some manner. Another way would be through
                    teaching or providing help with any past courses I have taken in college or high school.

                    In the past in high shcool, I volunteered for multiple days at a donation store. At the store people could come in drop off
                    things to donate or they could drive to the donation drive outside and drop off things. I volunteered both in the store
                    and outside to help pack and load various items. I also helped inside in the kitchen and in the store cleaning and rearranging things.

                <p>
                    When I was in high shcool I volunteered at my old middle school. I was with some other friends and we worked in the library
                    and we were supposed to rearrange the book shelves. While it is a pretty simple job to do, it was very taxing because of the
                    sheer amount of books in the library. It was a nice experience though as it made me feel good to be able to give back in
                    some manner to a place that has given me so much throughout the years.
